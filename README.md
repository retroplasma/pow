# Peer-to-peer mini r/place with Proof of Work
*or "SHA256 Battle"*

Project + code: https://tropical.pages.dev/pow/

I haven't uploaded the code to this Git repository, but you can see it by viewing the source of the webpage linked above. It's JavaScript.

## What is it?
- Who has mined the hardest will have their text shown on the website.
- There is also a small wall of pixels. Each pixel can be mined.
- It's also possible to "vote" (mine) on the best color among four (third screenshot).
- Proof of Work with basic gossip over P2P (STUN/TURN)
- e.g. for text: the smallest sha256(nonce + text) value seen in P2P network should be displayed on top of this page *[1]*

*[1] nonce placement could be improved*

## Current State
- People found some nice hashes. Best hash of text: ``00000000000003f5b562d3feca28eadb16ef1e2f051550344f62f1848e3d3dc6``
- It was a fun experiment. There were more ideas for it, but the project hasn't been worked on for a while.
- Maintaining STUN/TURN etc. was annoying so I don't do it anymore. The best submissions (best hashes) have been cached.
